## Leisure Activities:
In my spare time, I have experimented in several PHP frameworks such as CakePHP, Yii and Zend Framework in order to expand my knowledge. This mainly consisted of running through several tutorials and building a test project to get a grasp of how the framework worked.

At the age of 9 I began learning to play the saxophone reaching grade 4.  At high school, I was a member of the school jazz band, performing in concerts, such as local jazz festivals, visiting care homes and a tour of Normandy during one summer holiday where we took part in a number of outdoor performances.
 
I was in the scouts for many years and had become a young leader. I enjoyed planning and going hiking, as it meant I could relax in the outdoors.
